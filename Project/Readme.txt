The two .ipynb files run seamlessly on google colab(https://colab.research.google.com). 
Change the runtime to use GPU instances to make the training faster.
The .apk file is self signed and needs to be installed on an android phone with camera to use it.

The .ipynb files generate the model upon running them and that was inturn used to build the apk, 
with the help of the project,
https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android

Both the .ipynb files are self contained and downloads, pre-processes and trains the data themselves.
The Report.pdf contains the report of the project.
